===================

Simulation code for the Modified Dynamic DRF Algorithm.

"DRFAlgorithm.java" inside 'src' directory is the implementation of the actual algorithm which uses DemandModel and AllocationModel classes as the type for Demand and Allocation values respectively.

The other classes apart from these are for result generation dynamically to compare between First Fit allocation already implemented in CloudStack and the implemented algorithm.

This algorithm was implemented in CloudStack by making few changes to its source but the modified CloudStack source code was not uploaded in this space because of its huge size.
